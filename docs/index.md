# vnatk (vue-node agile tool kit)

VNATK is a combination of frontend and backend framework to develop APP seemlessly, based on Vuetify & express-sequelize.
While this documentation is dedicated to VNATK-VUE, The forntend part, you have to check its counter express-sequelize part also to get it work.

Being a developer, I have seen developers repeating same tasks again and again and I really wanted to focus on what business needs. So, here I am with this Framework.

## vnatk-express-sequelize (VES)

VES is a sequelize-query language enabled framework implementation, inspired with GraphQL. This framework removes need to create API's for almost all trivial to mid-size complex queries. You can use VES as stadalone API framework, but the framework is designed to back vnatk-vue framework, that really boost your development on very next level.
